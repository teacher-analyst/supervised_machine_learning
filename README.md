# Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Overview of the Analysis
As part of module 20 challenge of the Monash University Data Analytics Bootcamp, I am tasked with building a logistic regression model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. The lending_data.csv file contains historical data from a peer-to-peer lending service company such as borrower income, loan size, interest rate, total debt and loan status. The loan status column has values of 0 and 1 which represent a healthy loan and high-risk loan respectively. The model tries to predict the creditworthiness by displaying a value of 0 or 1. Based on the model's predictions and actual loan status, an assessment is made about the effectiveness of the model. 

## Results

The results of the classification report are:

**Healthy Loan:**
- precision: 1
- recall: 1

**High-risk Loan**
- precision: 0.87
- recall: 0.89
  
## Summary

Summarise the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
